<h2 align="center">MULTI CANCER DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the leading causes of death worldwide is cancer. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving the chances of successful treatment. Recent studies have identified several existing models designed for specific cancer detection, each with its drawbacks such as increased computational complexity, low accuracy, limited class coverage, and reliance on small datasets. In this research, we propose a single model capable of detecting eight types of cancer, including lung, cervical, breast, brain, kidney, and oral cancers, using deep learning techniques. The diseases are categorized into two subsets, referred to as Task 1 and Task 2. Notably, individuals afflicted with a condition from Task 1 may also suffer from a Task 2-related disease. Our model will undergo evaluation using a publicly available multi-cancer dataset from Kaggle. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 99.03% and 97.02% for Task 1 and Task 2, respectively.</p>
